# Cosmic Dynamics Interactive Simulation

In this project, I created an interactive simulation to explore how the universe evolves over time by modeling the Friedmann equation. My goal was to visualize how different cosmic parameters affect the universe's expansion through an intuitive interface. The creation of this project was motivated by the desire to teach a crash course of cosmology in Hong Kong secondary schools over the summer of 2024, and it also served as the final project of PHYSICS C162 Relativistic Astrophysics.
